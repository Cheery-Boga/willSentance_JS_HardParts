functions that return functions are known as closures

functions are the only objects that you can invoke

in higher-order functions, the function that we pass in is a callback function, or passes out (returns) a function. The outer function that takes in the function (our callback) is a higher-order function

Callback and higher order functions simplify our code and keep it DRY
and they do something even more powerful - they allow us to run asynchronous code

the beauty of higher order functions is that we determine our data and the specific functionality at run time.
